This is a new Xcode project directory created separately to avoid any risk to existing files.

To set up the BugHawkAI iOS app in this new project:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project named "BugHawkAIAppNew".
2. Set the organization identifier to "com.bughawkai".
3. Choose SwiftUI as the interface and Swift as the language.
4. Add the existing source files from mobile/ios/BugHawkAI_iOS/ (such as BugHawkAIApp.swift, ContentView.swift, Models, Services, Utils, Views) to the new project.
5. Configure the Info.plist and build settings as needed (e.g., deployment target iOS 15.0).
6. Set the API base URL in APIService.swift to point to your backend.
7. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.

This approach keeps your original project intact and allows safe development in the new project.
